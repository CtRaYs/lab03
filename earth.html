					Planet Earth is the third planet from the Sun in the solar system. It is the only known planet on which life exists. The Earth has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers and is covered with 70% of its surface by water. Its atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), making it suitable for breathing and supporting life.

The Earth has a variety of climates and landscapes, including mountains, plains, oceans and deserts. It is also rich in biological diversity, with millions of species of living organisms, including plants, animals and microorganisms.

Humanity has lived on Earth for many millennia and influenced the environment. Industrialization, technological development and population growth have led to changes in ecosystems and caused problems such as air and water pollution, loss of biodiversity and climate change.

Preserving the Earth is becoming an increasingly important task. Global efforts are aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting vulnerable ecosystems and ensuring sustainable use of resources.

The earth is our home, and it is important to take care of it to provide future generations with a favorable living environment.
