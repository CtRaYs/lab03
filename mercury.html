					Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun in the Solar System and the smallest planet in our system. It is named after the Roman god of trade, speed and travel.
Mercury has a diameter of about 4,879 kilometers and is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Due to its proximity to the Sun, Mercury's surface is very hot and can reach up to 430 degrees Celsius during the daytime and drop to -180 degrees Celsius at night.

The surface of Mercury is covered with many craters that were formed from meteorite collisions. Some of these craters are named after famous artists, musicians and writers. Extended valleys and hills are visible on its surface, as well as huge plateaus and gorges.

In some craters you can find ice that is preserved below, since these places do not receive solar radiation. This find indicates the existence of water on Mercury.

Mercury is also known for its long, narrow lines called mercurial flares. They occur due to the presence of a thin layer of regolith (mixed surface rock) on the planet's surface, which reflects the light of the Sun.

Due to its proximity to the Sun, the planet has a very short annual time of about 88 Earth days. However, Mercury rotates slower than its orbit around the Sun, so its average day, consisting of rotation on its axis, lasts about 176 Earth days.

The study of Mercury began in the mid-20th century with the help of space probes. So far, several missions have been sent to study this mysterious planet. The great mission was from NASA, MESSENGER, which was carried out in 2011-2015. She made many interesting findings about the geology, composition and magnetic field of Mercury.

Although Mercury has been studied relatively recently and remains a mystery to scientists, its study helps expand our knowledge of the origin and development of planets in the solar system.
