					Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system. It is named after the ancient Roman god of agriculture and has a unique ring system consisting of ice, rocks and dust.

Saturn has 82 known moons, including the largest moon in the solar system, Ganymede. Saturn's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, and the average temperature on the planet is -126 degrees Celsius.

The surface of Saturn is covered with many clouds consisting of ammonia, water and methane. Saturn also has powerful magnetic fields, radiation belts, and thunderstorms that create bright lightning and strong magnetic storms.

Research on Saturn began in the 19th century and continues to this day. In the 20th and 21st centuries, many space missions were sent, including Voyager, Cassini and Juno, to study the planet and its moons.
