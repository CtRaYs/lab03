					Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the seventh largest among all the planets in our solar system. It was named after the Roman god of war, and its surface is covered with craters, canyons, volcanoes and other geological formations.

Mars has two satellites - Phobos and Deimos, which were discovered in 1877 by American astronomer Asaph Hall. These moons are the smallest moons of the planets in our solar system and are irregularly shaped.

The atmosphere of Mars is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, but also contains traces of oxygen, water vapor and other gases. The average temperature on the surface of Mars is -63 degrees Celsius, and the atmospheric pressure is 160 times less than on Earth.

Mars has polar ice caps made of water ice, as well as many dry valleys that may have once been filled with water. The planet also contains traces of past geological activity, such as volcanoes and canyons.

Mars exploration is one of the main goals of space agencies around the world, including NASA, the European Space Agency and Roscosmos.
