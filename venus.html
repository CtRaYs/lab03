					Venus is the second planet from the Sun, located at a distance of 0.72 astronomical units from Earth. She was named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, as she is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus is a terrestrial planet with a silicate surface covered by a thick layer of sulfuric acid clouds. Its radius is 6051.8 km and its mass is 4.87×10^24 kg, making it the smallest and lightest planet in the Solar System.

Venus has extreme surface conditions with an average temperature of 870 K and a pressure of 92 bar, making it impossible for liquid water to exist. The atmosphere consists predominantly of carbon dioxide (96.5%) with a small amount of nitrogen (3.5%). There are also traces of other gases in the atmosphere, such as oxygen, water vapor and sulfur.

Unlike Earth, Venus does not have a magnetic field to protect it from the solar wind. Because of this, its atmosphere is gradually escaping into space, which could lead to mass loss in the future.
