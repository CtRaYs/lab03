					Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in our solar system. It was named after the Roman king of the gods and is known for its bright streaks formed by different types of clouds.

Jupiter has 79 known moons, including the four largest Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. These moons were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610 and were the first objects other than Earth to be discovered as satellites of another planet.

Jupiter's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with small amounts of methane, ammonia and water. The average temperature on the planet is -153 degrees Celsius, and the atmospheric pressure on the surface of Jupiter is 2.4 million times greater than on Earth.

The surface of Jupiter is covered with many stripes and spots that are formed due to various types of clouds and atmospheric phenomena. Jupiter also has powerful magnetic fields and radiation belts that create strong magnetic storms and radiation.

Research on Jupiter began in the 19th century, when its moons were discovered.
